  <h1>Genesynth: A Sega Genesis-inspired synthesizer</h1>
  <content>
    <p>My largest side project over the last year has been the <em>Genesynth</em> - an open-source hardware synthesizer inspired by the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. It started with a <a href="../genesynth-part-1-idea-and-research">crazy idea</a> and amazingly ended up with a functional, incredible sounding synthesizer.</p>
<p><img src="../static/genesynth-promo.jpg" alt="YM2612 Registers" /></p>
<p>While I'm not <em>totally</em> done with the project, it's close enough for me to really share it with the world. This post introduces you to this synthesizer and how I built it. Feedback is always welcome, and I would especially love to know which technical details you'd like me to go into in future blog posts.</p>
<h2>The inspiration</h2>
<p>As noted in my first <a href="../genesynth-part-1-idea-and-research">build log</a> about the Genesynth, I grew up listening to Sega Genesis music and it left a permanent impression on me. The Genesis was one of the last consoles to feature a synthesizer chip instead of the samplers and CD playback that later consoles would adopt. It used an (at the time) relatively advanced FM synthesizer chip from Yamaha, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2612">YM2612</a>. The Genesis gave us some of the most iconic game soundtracks, and they were all brought to life using this chip's distinct voice.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I set out to re-create this sound in a hardware synthesizer.</p>
<h2>The modern-day recreation of Genesis sound</h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="600" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vb1WasXNGOw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/646940496&color=%23433b38&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
<p>The Genesynth uses the same YM2612 6 voice FM synthesis chip as the one used for the Sega Genesis. A <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy35.html">Teensy 3.5</a> interfaces between the chip and MIDI-over-USB providing real-time control of all of the chip's parameters, patch loading, and various polyphony modes.</p>
<p>The synth features a <a href="../genesynth-part-3-proper-audio">high-quality audio amplifier</a> that far exceeds the original Genesis version while retaining the same filter roll-off. This means that you can <em>hear</em> the chip's 9-bit DAC's distortion, or the so-called <a href="http://alyjameslab.blogspot.com/2013/06/ym2612-ladder-effect-suite.html">&quot;ladder effect&quot;</a> quite clearly, such as during the long sustain parts in these clips:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/558684303%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ywqmF&color=%23433b38&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/524990358%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vg1gD&color=%23433b38&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
<p>Because all of the parameters are exposed over MIDI you can build things like <a href="http://ctrlr.org/">Ctrlr</a> panels to control the parameters in real-time:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because I&#39;m super bored tonight here&#39;s some more synth noodling.<br><br>I&#39;ve got basically all of the parameters exposed to Ableton now. :)<br><br>The envelopes on this thing are actually quite usable once you get the hang of it. Some super fun sounds can happen with envelopes + unison. <a href="https://t.co/dKdxrvlUK2">pic.twitter.com/dKdxrvlUK2</a></p>&mdash; Thea Flowers ðŸŒº (@theavalkyrie) <a href="https://twitter.com/theavalkyrie/status/1086522285651947520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

<h2>Creating the Genesynth</h2>
<p>Creating this project took weeks of research, months of iteration, and nearly a year of programming. This is the <em>first</em> synthesizer I've ever built, and my first <em>real</em> hardware project. I even learned how to make PCBs for this project! There were so many difficult areas and times that I felt like abandoning it but every breakthrough meant I got to hear more cool sounds come out of these magic rocks. This positive feedback loop kept me encouraged to continue the project.</p>
<p>My original version of the hardware was created on breadboards and had no MIDI functionality, just VGM playback:</p>
<p><img src="../static/genesynth-breadboard.jpg" alt="First Genesynth" /></p>
<p>It eventually moved to more permanent protoboards:</p>
<p><img src="../static/genesynth-protoboard.jpg" alt="Second Genesynth" /></p>
<p>And then finally, in order to have the <a href="../genesynth-part-4-cleaning-up-the-noise-in-synth-audio-amplifier">best possible audio quality</a>, I ended up creating custom PCBs:</p>
<p><img src="../static/genesynth-pcbs.jpg" alt="Genesynth PCBs" /></p>
<p>And just last week I finally placed everything into a laser-cut acrylic case:</p>
<p><img src="../static/genesynth-case.jpg" alt="Genesynth in its case" /></p>
<p>The software went through several iterations as well. As mentioned, it initially just had VGM playback - as there was a lot of prior art I could draw from there. Eventually, once I was able to verify my timing and hardware was functioning, I began implementing patch loading and MIDI functionality. Finally, I started coding a simple user interface for loading patches and displaying parameter states when being controlled over midi.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It now shows the FM algorithm used by the current patch!<br><br>(This was a lot of code to do. Basically manually drawing all these little graphs) <a href="https://t.co/Nj9GdJz9y3">https://t.co/Nj9GdJz9y3</a> <a href="https://t.co/0OnhmCOqrk">pic.twitter.com/0OnhmCOqrk</a></p>&mdash; Thea Flowers ðŸŒº (@theavalkyrie) <a href="https://twitter.com/theavalkyrie/status/1052809544479342592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

<h2>Creating your own</h2>
<p>Genesynth is open-source hardware. Everything I put into creating this is available on my GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/genesynth">https://github.com/theacodes/genesynth</a>. I would <em>love</em> to see other people build these and I would <em>love</em> feedback if you do.</p>
<p>If you're more interested in just buying one, I wouldn't recommend offering me money to build an incomplete side project for you - I would recommend <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/Kasser/dafm-synth-genesis-ym2612-ym3438/">the DAFM synthesizer</a> instead.</p>
<h2>Read more</h2>
<p>I've written other blog posts about the build process:</p>

</ul>
<p>There's also a big <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1016762308553371648">Twitter Moment</a> that collects all of my Tweets about this project. Finally, there's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synthdiy/comments/ahtl2r/yall_seemed_to_like_my_sega_genesis_inspired/">post on /r/synthdiy</a>.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gusclass.com/">Gus Class</a> for reviewing this post and always being enthusiastic about this project.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.aidanlawrence.com/">Aidan Lawrence</a> who's previous work in this area was invaluable to me, but they also went out of their way to answer questions and provide me with translations of Japanese documentation.</li>
<li>The pseudonymous creators of the <a href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?26568-Introducing-the-Mega-Amp-The-universal-Genesis-audio-circuit">Mega Amp</a> mod for the Sega Genesis.</li>
<li>Maxim's World of Stuff has the most complete <a href="http://www.smspower.org/maxim/Documents/YM2612">documentation on the YM2612</a> and none of this would've been possible without it.</li>
<li>Aly James' <a href="http://www.alyjameslab.com/alyjameslabfmdrive.html">FMDrive</a> provided the basis for patch saving and loading.</li>
<li>The /r/synthdiy and /r/askelectronics communities on Reddit. Both were helpful and encouraging during this process.</li>
</ul>
