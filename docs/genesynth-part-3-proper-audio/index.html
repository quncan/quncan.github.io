  <h1>Genesynth part 3: proper audio amplification</h1>

<p><em>Catch <a href="../genesynth-part-1-idea-and-research">part 1</a> and <a href="../genesynth-part-2-basic-communication">part 2</a> if you missed them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the previous posts I managed to get microcontroller (<a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy35.html">Teensy 3.5</a>) talking the YM2612 and making some sounds. The next step is to get the audio output out of the YM2612 into a proper audio (pre)amplifier.</p>
<p>Having the microcontroller work as a <a href="http://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_File_Format">VGM</a> player is super advantageous at this stage. A VGM player is <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/genesynth/blob/da421870a016c0b16930cb417286ae8897aa3778/vgm.cpp">relatively straightforward to implement</a> and plays music without any human intervention. This frees me up to focus on just making the audio output work without having to implement the entire MIDI functionality.</p>
<h2>Why is this necessary?</h2>
<p>The YM2612 directly outputs an audio signal but it's not appropriate to use as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level">line-level audio</a> as-is. The YM2612 can't <em>drive</em> very much current out of its output pins so trying to use it directly will lead to overheating and damaging the chip (it might work for a few minutes, but you're playing with fire). A minimum, you'll need an active buffer between the chip and output to protect it. A buffer is a good start, but it also needs to be <em>amplified</em> a bit to get up to line level. Finally, since I want mono output here I need to combine the left and right audio signals.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I wanted the Genesynth to closely match the sound of the original Genesis. I did some research and found some excellent material in the Genesis modding community, specifically the MegaAmp mod.</p>
<p><img src="../static/megaamp.png" alt="Mega Amp Schematic" /></p>
<p>MegaAmp uses a TL074 Quad Op-Amp configured first as an <a href="http://sound.whsites.net/articles/audio-mixing.htm#s3">active mixer/summing amplifier</a> to combine the YM2612 and SN76489 signals and then as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_amplifier#Op-amp_implementation">a buffer</a> to drive the final audio output. It also has capacitor values for filtering the same frequencies as the original Genesis. This is exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>I built the MegaAmp circuit on a protoboard and wired it up to my prototype:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know that I said I was finally going to do midi next, but! two wonderful things happened:<br><br>1. The PSG (SN76489) came from China early!<br>2.

<p>The result was quite nice!</p>

<h2>Problems (&amp; solutions)</h2>
<p>This circuit worked great, but I started to run into the limits of my electronics knowledge. I've never really worked with analog circuits at all so when things went wrong with the circuit I mostly just ended up rebuilding it until it worked. I ended up doing a lot of research and watching a lot of videos around Op Amps to feel more confident working with this particular circuit.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that the audio amplifier is <em>noisy</em>. You can hear it a bit in the recording above, but it was actually seriously obnoxious and really made it hard for me to believe that I was doing things correctly here. I did a lot of research on this as well, looking at everything from split ground planes to inductors. This problem actually prompted me to do something I hadn't planned to do - build a printed circuit board (PCB) for this synthesizer. I <em>did</em> eventually solve this issue and got crystal clear audio using this circuit. I'll cover that in another post.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>In the next post, I'll talk about moving the circuit to a protoboard and some of the first steps with MIDI. In a later post, I'll talk about designing PCBs.</p>
